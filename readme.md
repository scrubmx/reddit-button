# Reddit: The Button

###### The button was game and a social experiment created on reddit on April 1st.

## Context
**There's a timer counting down from 60**. When you hit the button it resets the counter. **You can only push the button once**, and you can't just create a new account to push it again.

Users are now divided as "Button clickers" and "Non-Clickers"
